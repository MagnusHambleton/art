Enable your microphone to use this script. The script will take the sound specrtum coming in through the mic
and turn it into a colour based on how the eye would perceive the equivalent light spectrum. For more information
on the way this is done, [see the dedicated blog post on turning sound into color](https://analogmantra.com/most-things-sound-blue-green-4af988ea8f85).

The animation will stop/start when you click anywhere in the window. 

**To start, allow access to your microphone, then tap/click the black box below**
